* Release
  - Gentoo :: A flexible, source-based Linux distribution that becomes just
    about any system you needâ€”and much more. You can choose what you want to
    install with a package.
      - Anything(installation, development environment, overlay or others) about
        it can be fountd on its [[http://wiki.gentoo.org/][*wiki*]].
  - NixOS :: NixOS is a Linux distribution with a unique approach to package and
    configuration management. Built on top of the Nix package manager, it is
    completely declarative, makes upgrading systems reliable, and has many
    other advantages.

  Both of them are my love. And the archlinux's wiki is the best wiki I think.
