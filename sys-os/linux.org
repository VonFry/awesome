* release

- Gentoo - A flexible, source-based Linux distribution that becomes just about any system you need—and much more. You can choose what you want to install with a package.
- NixOS - NixOS is a Linux distribution with a unique approach to package and configuration management. Built on top of the Nix package manager, it is completely declarative, makes upgrading systems reliable, and has many other advantages.

Both of them are my love. And the archlinux's wiki is the best wiki I think.

I use Gentoo for my main server, and use nixos to do something quickly. Gentoo needs more time to configure and install.
