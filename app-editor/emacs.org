Emacs is one of the best editor on the world. Its default editing mode is used in many morden editors such as all text input form on macos.

But I don't like emacs default editing method. I use evil insteaded.

The most powerful thing is ~emacs-lisp~. You can de anything here! So, why not use it with vim.

And emacs author seems hardworking more than vim.

* configure
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: configure-id

  Here are some samples, but I suggest only take a look as a reference. Write config by yourself!

  - [[https://github.com/VonFry/dotfiles/tree/master/emacs.d][mine]]
  - [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude.git][prelude]] - very very very /Simple/
  - [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][doom]]
  - [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][Spacemacs]] - It is too heavy, just use it as a reference.
