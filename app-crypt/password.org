* Password Manager
  - 1Password :: Private password managem.
  - [[https://www.passwordstore.org/][pass]] :: Password management should be simple and follow Unix
    philosophy. With pass, each password lives inside of a gpg encrypted file
    whose filename is the title of the website or resource that requires the
    password. These encrypted files may be organized into meaningful folder
    hierarchies, copied from computer to computer, and, in general, manipulated
    using standard command line file management utilities.
