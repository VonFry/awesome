* PGP

Pretty Good Privacy is a nice way to crypt data.

** GnuPG

A implement of pgp.

Use PGP to send message, which like whatsapp but this won't manage you keys, so it is safter. A end-to-end encryption is the best way to exchange message.

It also is a platform to show your public key. I love it!
