An extensive list of interesting open source projects, articles and other things for _myself_.

## file type

All files are written in `org-mode`, `markdown` or `tex`.

All content are managed by dir's name.

`section -> content(file)`

The _readme file_ in each section contains some public, unitversal items or represent the section self.

_misc file_ has contents which are like the file name, __misc__.
