This mainly means linux/unix shell. Winodows powershell is good, but hardly using for daily and we have other better language for scripts, if you don't use ~.net~.

* Shell
  - sh - Please write script use this.
  - bash - The default one, it is inconvenient to use.
  - zsh - Quickly, easy, having a lot of plugins and more interactive.
    - Framework
      - antigen - plugin manager, it can manage compiling and plugins automatically. Fast!
      - prezto - simple and fast.
      - oh-my-zsh - Powerful! But slowly! NOT RECOMMENDED.
    - Plugins - See [[https://github.com/VonFry/dotfiles/blob/master/antigenrc][dotfiles/antigenrc]]
      - autosuggestions - fish like
      - syntax-highlighting - fish like
  - fish - Like zsh, but it contains a lot of functions which are implemented by plugis. It also has a more morden shell script, but /not posix/, so conflicting with some tools.
  - tcsh
  - powershell - Support by windows. Combine with ~.NET~. It has a superior script language, but using for interactive is bad. And why not using ruby, perl, python or other scripting language? More about see: [[../sys-os/windows.org][sys-os/windows.org]]
  - [[http://xon.sh/][xonsh]] - python based

  I'm using zsh with antigen and prezto. Oh-my-zsh is good, having a lot of functions but I don't need them. The most important reason is speed and stdandard, for example, oh-my-zsh uses ~source~ to load theme, prezto uses ~zstyle~.

* Tools
  List some useful tools.
  - autojump - quickly jump to dirs.
  - googler - google in terminal
  - lolcat - colorful cat
  - tree - show dir structure as a tree
  - colordiff
  - fortune - print a saying
  - cmatrix - show coding matrix in terminal
  - figlet - ascii art
  - gpatch - Apply a diff file to an original
  - parallel - like xargs, but use more cpus
  - tmux - more powerful tool like screen
  - thefuck - fix input error in command
  - fzf - fuzzy search
  - [[https://github.com/sharkdp/bat][bat]] - A cat(1) clone with wings.
  - [[https://github.com/aviaviavi/confetti][confetti]] - a configuration file swapping tool
  - asciinema - Terminal session recorder
  - shellcheck - ShellCheck, a static analysis tool for shell scripts
  - [[https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger][simonmichael/hledger]] - The hledger command-line/curses/web accounting tool, a Haskell rewrite of ledger

** Useless
   - [[https://github.com/svenstaro/genact][genact]] - Pretend to be busy or waiting for your computer when you should actually be doing real work! Impress people with your insane multitasking skills. Just open a few instances of genact and watch the show. genact has multiple scenes that pretend to be doing something exciting or useful when in reality nothing is happening at all.
